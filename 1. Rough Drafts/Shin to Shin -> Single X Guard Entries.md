### Shin to Shin to Single X 
- Find a way to off balance opp away from the shin to shin leg to make the shin to shin leg light
- Can always transition single x to the other leg if their base and legs are far apart
- If they put pressure into me hard and try to drive the knee through, grab the far arm and take away the base, pull the far arm to my chest and complete the shin to shin single x entry
- Can always go for the arm and lapel sweep if they allow their arm to get dragged through their shin to shin leg
