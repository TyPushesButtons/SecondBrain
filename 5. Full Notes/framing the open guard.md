# **framing the open guard**

### Keep legs active, toes pointed back, and knees close to chest
### Use hands to frame your open guard
- Post hand on outside leg to not let opponent push leg to mat
	- avoid knee slides and leg drags

- Post hand on top of thigh to avoid the stack pass while shoulder walking away from opponent
	- 1. Immediately grab both wrists
	- 2. Use legs to break grip
	- 3. Pummel leg to avoid hip control
	- 4. Regrip
### Use hands to pull your framed knee to pummel leg
- This should be used when the frame is solid and the opponent is pushing on the frame but your leg feels stuck
### Stop the Toreando 
- 1. Force opponent to inside leg grip (dont let them grip outside leg or shin... its easier to pull legs down)
- 2. Bring knees to chest
- 3. Pull knees with hands to help pull knees to chest
-  -Opponent might keep pulling-
- 4. Break opponents grip by pummeling leg
- 5. Get grips (collar sleeve)
