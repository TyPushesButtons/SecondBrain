### Key Details
- Drive inside knee over opps quad almost like youre trying to knee cut across his hip
- Keep the pressure heavy over the hips, dont try to turn the corner of his butt
- Try to stay as upright as possible after diving for the hip to drive pressure into the inside leg

#### This will create three situations:
1. The opp will try to push me off with his quads
2. Opp will frame my chest and head
3. Opp will grab my inside leg

## If Pushes with Quad
- Move hand to outside of the thigh and drag hard to secure the pass
- Leg drag is viable since his legs will be stiff
- Gap between thigh and hip will open if I explode quick enough

## If Frame Chest and Head
- Invert to attack the other side (if the inside leg is deep)
	- scramble out if needed using the invert
	- try to get the x hook if my bottom leg is mobile
	- if I can get the x and invert, it becomes a crab ride
- If the inside leg is deep, drive it across the body, move the inside hand to outside thigh, and spin to the back to leg weave (Ryne's pass)

## If Grab Leg
- Pull into armbar by hooking the far armpit with bottom leg like we do when getting into x from DULG. Then grab the arm with the inside hand and pull the shoulder into hips to secure the arm
