### Always look for crazy dog first
- If crazy dog isnt working, try to transition to these other passes
1. Try double up on the lapel through the leg instead of grabbing the pants, then keep pressure drop hips, and drive to cross shoulder. When he keeps the top leg in, keep driving through the head and grab cross face to finish.
2. Pummel the legs while PUSHING the leg down. Pummel the outside leg in first then pummel the second leg in. Stay sitting up throughout this. Bring left knee in to block the bottom leg and drag the top leg with your right hand. Cross face and drive to cross shoulder
3. If I can only pummel the outside leg in, push open leg away and dive for DULG
